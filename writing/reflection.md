### First Tool - Next-Generation Sequencing

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

This method is used in studying the evolution of a genetic sequence
over time, especially trying to predict the evolution of viruses and
therefore better understand how to control their spread or develop
treatment and preventive medications that will work despite this
evolution.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

This is the method of identifying the DNA sequence of the organism,
and writing this out in full or partially, and then furthering
this process by using it to predict the changes in the DNA that
will develop as the organism evolves. The data to complete this
process can be taken directly from medical samples, or from
existing data about the genetic material.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

In the case of major health-related events that stem from another
organism, it could save many lives to have this method because it
gives the eventual ability to be one step ahead of the problem.
It also saves time that could be spent developing treatments or
preventive medications that could become obsolete if the direction
the virus is evolving in ways not understood at the time of creating
these treatments. Knowledge gathered from this method can help
increase confidence in the treatments to work as expected, and
give understanding to when a treatment may need to be changed to
accommodate the evolution.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

If the data collected through this method is not shared openly, it could result
in some countries or groups of people being at greater risk of a condition,
disease, or bacteria when they knowledge necessary to treat it already
exists.
